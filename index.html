        <p>
          RULES: When the Start button is clicked the timer in the top right
          corner will begin counting down from 75 seconds and the first question
          will appear. The next question will appear automatically after the
          current question has been answered. Make it through the quiz as quickly
          as possible as the time remaining at the end will be your score. Beware
          answering incorrectly! Each incorrect answer takes 15 seconds off the
          clock!
        </p>
